 Description for Apple Store
------------------------------

Power your study designs wherever you go. 

'GLIMMPSE Lite' is a free, user-friendly and open source smart-phone application
which allows students, researchers, and statisticians to calculate power and sample
size for one way analysis of variance.

The simple user interface allows scientists to quickly enter information 
about the number of groups, the Type I Error rate, and choices for means 
and standard deviations.  Integrated tutorials provide guidance on appropriate 
inputs for the power or sample size calculation. The researcher may solve 
for either power or sample size, and save the results. 

Additional documentation, validation results, and theoretical details are available at

http://samplesizeshop.org/.

'GLIMMPSE Lite' provides a subset of the functionality of GLIMMPSE, a 
a free, user-friendly and open source web application which calculates 
power and sample size for the general linear multivariate model with normally 
distributed outcomes.  GLIMMPSE is hosted at

http://glimmpse.samplesizeshop.org/.

"GLIMMPSE Lite" is supported on both Android and iOS platforms.
